A simple console-based TicTacToe game written in Java for learning purposes.

# How to build and run
1) Ensure `java` is installed on your system.
2) Either clone the repository or copy `main.java` file.
3) Run command `javac main.java` to build.
4) Run command `java Main` to execute the `Main` class and run the game.

Optional: You can also do `javac main.java && java Main` to directly build and run in one command.
